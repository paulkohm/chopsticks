My kids play a game called "chopsticks". It's described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks_(hand_game)

On vacation in June 2016, I talked to my kids about trying to create a computerized version of the game, to explore building
game AI.

For starters, I've created a playable terminal-based version of it.

Written in python 3, this requires no external libraries.

No AI yet.
